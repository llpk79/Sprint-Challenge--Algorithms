#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n)
It will require computing (n * n) n times.
b)
O(n)
Both loops are dependent on n.

c)
O(n)
Makes bunnies number of calls to the stack.

## Exercise II
Do a binary search for f.

Start at the middle floor, if the egg breaks, go lower by half
if it doesn't go higher by half.
Continue until the lowest floor the egg doesn't break is found.
Runtime complexity is O(log n) as we halve our data each step.
